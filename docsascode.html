            <h1>Docs as Code</h1>

            <h2 id="C1">Explanation</h2>

                <p>The Docs as Code philosophy treats documentation with the same care, discipline, and tooling 
                    as software development. Instead of writing in word processors or content management 
                    systems that hide version history, technical writers work with plain-text source 
                    files—often in Markdown, AsciiDoc, or reStructuredText—stored in a Git repository. 
                    Git will be explained in detail later in this section. This approach recognizes that 
                    documentation is not an afterthought or a separate artifact, but an integral part of the 
                    software itself. When the documentation and the code share the same version control system, 
                    they can evolve together, ensuring accuracy and alignment with product changes.</p>

                <p>At its core, Docs as Code is built around the same workflows developers use every day. 
                    Writers create and edit content in branches, submit pull requests for peer review, and 
                    rely on tools like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for collaboration and versioning. 
                    This brings transparency and accountability to documentation: every edit has an author, 
                    a timestamp, and a record of discussion. Automated builds and tests—powered by continuous 
                    integration (CI) pipelines—can check for spelling errors, broken links, or formatting issues,
                    and even publish updates to a live documentation site when approved changes are merged. 
                    CI/CD pipelines will be explained in detail later in this section.</p>

                <p>This method also improves collaboration between writers and developers. Because the 
                    documentation lives alongside the code, developers can easily update or annotate content 
                    as they implement new features. Technical writers gain greater visibility into software 
                    changes and can review differences (“diffs”) to see exactly what’s been modified. The shared 
                    environment encourages knowledge exchange: writers become more familiar with the technical 
                    context, while developers gain appreciation for the clarity and accuracy of good documentation.</p>

                <p>However, adopting Docs as Code requires a cultural and technical adjustment. Writers must 
                    learn to use developer tools such as Git, the command line, and text editors like Visual 
                    Studio Code. Reviewers must adapt to reading and commenting on documentation through pull 
                    requests rather than word processor track changes. Some nontechnical contributors may 
                    initially find the workflow intimidating. To succeed, organizations often invest in 
                    onboarding, templates, and automation to lower these barriers and make the Docs as Code 
                    pipeline more accessible to everyone involved.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, the Docs as Code model aligns documentation with modern software development 
                    practices—fast, iterative, and transparent. It allows teams to maintain versioned, testable, 
                    and easily deployable documentation that can be trusted as a single source of truth. By 
                    integrating writing into the same lifecycle as coding, Docs as Code transforms documentation 
                    from static deliverables into living, evolving systems of knowledge. It not only improves 
                    technical accuracy and consistency but also fosters a shared sense of ownership over 
                    communication and clarity across the entire product team.</p>

            <h2 id="C2">Version Control: Git/GitHub</h2>

                <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on the same 
                    project while keeping a complete, trackable history of every change. Originally created by 
                    Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the Linux kernel, Git records snapshots of a project’s 
                    files over time. Each contributor has a full local copy of the repository, meaning work can 
                    continue independently without constant internet access. Git’s branching and merging model 
                    makes it easy to experiment safely—you can create branches to test ideas or write 
                    documentation, then merge their changes back into the main project once reviewed.</p>

                <p>GitHub is a cloud-based platform built on top of Git that simplifies collaboration and version 
                    control. It hosts Git repositories online, providing a web interface where users can browse 
                    files, review code or documentation, report issues, and manage projects. GitHub adds social 
                    and organizational features like pull requests, code reviews, and discussions, making it 
                    easier for distributed teams to coordinate changes. It also integrates with continuous 
                    integration and deployment tools, allowing teams to automate testing, build, and publishing 
                    workflows.</p>

                <p>Together, Git and GitHub form the backbone of many modern development and documentation 
                    practices—including the Docs as Code approach. Writers and developers alike use Git to 
                    track and manage changes, while GitHub provides a shared space for collaboration, 
                    feedback, and publication. This combination enables transparency, accountability, and 
                    versioned control over every contribution, ensuring that projects—whether code or 
                    documentation—can evolve smoothly and consistently over time.</p>

            <h2 id="C3">CI/CD Pipeline</h2>

                <p>A CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) pipeline is an 
                    automated process that helps teams build, test, and release software—or 
                    documentation—more efficiently and reliably. In a CI/CD workflow, every time someone 
                    makes a change to the project (for example, updating code or editing docs), the system 
                    automatically integrates that change into a shared repository and runs a series of checks. 
                    These checks might include compiling code, running unit tests, validating formatting, or 
                    building a preview of the documentation site. The goal of continuous integration (CI) is to 
                    catch errors early, keep the project in a deployable state, and prevent integration conflicts
                     between contributors.</p>

                <p>Continuous deployment (or delivery) extends this process by automating what happens after the 
                    checks pass. In continuous delivery, the system prepares the latest successful build for 
                    release, allowing a human to approve the final deployment. In continuous deployment, the 
                    process goes a step further—automatically pushing the approved changes to production once 
                    they meet all criteria. This means updates, whether to software features or documentation, 
                    can reach users within minutes instead of days or weeks.</p>

                <p>In the context of Docs as Code, a CI/CD pipeline ensures that documentation is always up to 
                    date, tested, and published automatically when changes are merged. For example, a pipeline 
                    might check Markdown files for broken links, enforce style consistency, and then build a 
                    static site using tools like MkDocs or Sphinx. Once the tests pass, the system can deploy 
                    the updated site to a live server such as GitHub Pages or Netlify. This automation removes 
                    manual steps, reduces human error, and creates a predictable, repeatable process for 
                    delivering clear and accurate documentation.</p>

            <h2 id="C4">Implementation</h2>

                <h3>Implement Docs as Code for Your Business Group</h3>
                    <p>You’ve decided to use Git and GitHub to get and keep your docs organized and up to date. Now what? This
                    step-by-step breakdown will help you implement the changes necessary to get your team documentation
                    streamlined
                    with only one source of truth.
                    </p>

                <h3>Define Document Needs and Goals</h3>
                    <p>Defining your needs and goals is perhaps the most important step of this process. 
                        What types of documentation are necessary  for your team? SOPs? RFPs? How-To Guides? 
                        This will differ for every  business, but a clear list of all types of documentation 
                        required by your team should be your starting point. Make a list of each of these so you 
                        can categorize them.</p>

                <h3>Categorize Documentation</h3>
                    <p>When you create your repository, you want to make it as simple as possible for your team to 
                        find the document they’re looking for. Should policy documents be in the same file location 
                        as your How-To tutorials? Likely not. A simple and direct file structure is of paramount 
                        importance. Your list of document types is a great place to start.</p>

                <h3>Determine Document Format</h3>
                    <p>You should select the format that works best for your team. HTML & CSS are also easy to 
                        learn and great for creating a simple docs site. Your docs repository is meant to be a 
                        bridge between developers and various administrators/teams, so make sure you choose a 
                        format that everyone can use or learn easily.</p>    

                <h3>Download Git, GitHub and Visual Studio Code on Your Office Computer</h3>
                    <p>As the owner of the project, you’ll be setting up the team’s document repository. 
                        That comes at a later step. First, you must download the programs needed.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Git: <a href="https://git-scm.com/install/" target="_blank">download it here</a></li>
                        <li>GitHub: <a href="https://desktop.github.com/download/" target="_blank">download it here</a></li>
                        <li>VSC: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">download it here</a></li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Create a Docs Repository</h3>
                    <p>Your next task is to get started with Git and GitHub. We won’t go through each step here. 
                        Please jump to our <a href="gitexercises.html">Git</a> and <a href="githubexercises.html">GitHub</a> 
                        tutorial pages for instructions on how to download and use both programs.</p>

                <h3>Select Site Generator</h3>
                    <p>You’ve created your repository. Now you need to select a single site generator to host 
                        your site. GitHub allows for free publishing to their own site, GitPages. This is a 
                        great option for simple sites. Mkdocs [insert link] is an option that may be preferable 
                        if you plan to store a large volume of files or a complex file structure. See our 
                        <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page for more options.</p>

                <h3>Add all Existing Documentation (That You'll Keep) to Your Repository.</h3>
                    <p>If you have an existing file structure, you can “push” this to your GitHub repository. 
                        Make sure to reorganize your file structure and eliminate and defunct content first so 
                        that you’re starting with a functional system.</p>

                <!--<p>[tutorial on pushing existing file structure to GitHub repository? link? TBD]</p>-->

                <h3>Review Documentation for Accuracy and Update as Needed.</h3>
                    <p>Git will now be tracking your changes. Clone your repository [insert link to exercise] 
                        onto your computer and make changes locally. Then push those changes back to the main 
                        repository. Create a branch [insert link to exercise] if you want to keep the original 
                        document intact. You can make changes in a branch without changing the original document 
                        and only merge the two if your changes are approved.</p>    

                <h3>Download Git, GitHub, and/or Visual Studio Code on all Staff Computers.</h3>
                    <p>Direct appropriate staff to download Git and GitHub (and Visual Studio Code, if necessary) 
                        so all appropriate team members have access to edit and add documents to your repository. </p>
